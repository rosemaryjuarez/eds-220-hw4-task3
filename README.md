# Goals

The purpose of this repository is to explore and analyze the data of the Thomas fire and the air quality index during the fire in 2017. By wranging and vizualizing the data provided by US Environmental Protection Agency, CA State Geoportal, and NASA's Earth Observatory, I explored and analyzed the data.
